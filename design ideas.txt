To change:

Get rid of the padding, I wish to implement as much text of articles similar to a newspaper design


check out inside box layouts
I want to replicate that design from le monde of 
the headline, big image, content running at the side, and then smaller stories beneath.

I want to embrace some smaller text on some articles akin to a small newspaper article




Look to the times website for inspo. they tease the reader with the actual story text before needing the reader to click on the page. This could be done on all new websites successfully



need to add in a moving date and time below the header

want to add a ticker element to track some stocks also at the top
